Hi all,

we=E2=80=99re currently working on a DSL involving Reactive Streams types l=
ike Publisher[T] (yes, I realize that subscribe should employ use-site vari=
ance)  which owing to their Java origin are devoid of variance annotations.=
 This particular type is in fact covariant in T, which means that currently=
 within our DSL structure we need to use @uncheckedVariance in order to ach=
ieve the desired variance for our Flow[-In, +Out] type which interfaces wit=
h the Reactive Streams types.

While this is workable, it leaves an awkward feeling because even though I =
verified with suitably variant surrogates that everything is fine, someone =
might introduce breakage later during a refactoring. Would it not be safer =
to offer @assumedCovariant and @assumedContravariant instead of the ambiguo=
us @uncheckedVariance? That way we could at least inspect that Publisher wa=
s only ever @assumedCovariant and Subscriber @assumedContravariant, which i=
s difficult to verify now that @uncheckedVariance completely disables all t=
ests.

Regards,
