I've been exploring type-level programming in scala and created an 
extensible library for units of measure. I'd be curious if anyone else 
finds it useful?

https://github.com/gbeaty/scunits

scunits uses type-level lists of dimensions, but they differ from 
shapeless' hlist types in that they are constructed entirely from recursive 
`type` statements without the use of implicits. I didn't know what 
implicits would do to run-time performance and wanted to keep everything 
lean and of course value-classed. I also rolled my own type-level integers; 
does anyone know if there's a small library for this anywhere? I don't want 
to import shapeless or spire just for integer support.

It differs from other units libraries I've seen in that:

   - All measurements are value classes.
   - Its extensible - new base quantities can be added by the user.
   - Type errors are uniquely unreadable.
   - Basic abstract algebra is possible, e.g. Measure[A] * (Measure[B] / 
   Measure[A]) can be implicitly converted to Measure[A].
   - Its small (so far...) and a good size for my Android projects.
   - All measurements are stored as SI values and converted to other units 
   when needed, reducing complexity.

This is my first significant foray into type-level programming in scala, so 
comments and criticisms are welcome.
